== DESCRIPTION:

* match_each
* match_enum
* match_in_order

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'spec'
    require 'rspec_multi_matchers'
    
    describe 'array of ones' do
      it 'should be all ones' do
        [1,2,3].should each { |n| 
          n.should == 1
        }
      end
    end
    
    =begin output
    'array of ones should fail on 2' FAILED
        line: 14
      item 1: 2
    expected: 1,
         got: 2 (using ==)
    =end

As expected, the output shows expected and got fields
line is the line number of the expectiation inside the block
the item line gives the index of the item being yielded to the block, and the item itself


=== Warning

Note the use of brackets  '{ ... }' instead of 'do ... end'
this is necessary because 'do .. end' does not bind strong enough
